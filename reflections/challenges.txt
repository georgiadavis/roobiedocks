My anticipated challenges are that I will start mixing up Ruby and Python syntax. I’ve already dived pretty deep into Python so I’m wondering if I will be able to retain both. 

Also I am concerned I will not prioritize time for my own learning and focus only on my day job (a Course Developer at Udacity)
